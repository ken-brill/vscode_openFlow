# vscode_openFlow
A script to open flows in Salesforce from VS Code

How to Run It

    1) You’ve added the VS Code Task we set up earlier in .vscode/tasks.json
    2) You’ve opened a .flow-meta.xml file
    3) Then run:
        Cmd+Shift+P → Tasks: Run Task → Open Flow in Flow Builder
        Or use your keyboard shortcut (like Ctrl+Alt+F)
